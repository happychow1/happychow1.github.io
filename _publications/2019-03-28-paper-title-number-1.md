In this paper, Bi2Te3 nanowires were prepared in anodized aluminum oxide template by electrochemical deposition. The morphological microstructural and electrical resistance characteristics of the nanowires were discussed to reveal the effect of deposition potential and electroactive substance (HTeO2 +) concentration. According to the electrode dynamics formula, it is found that the increase of electrode potential leads to the decrease of deposition current, so that deposition rate of nanowires decreases. At the same time, the deposition current controlled by diffusion in the mass transport process will have a maximum value with the increasing of deposition time. The deposition potential determines the favorable crystal plane for nanowires growth by the selection of proper surface energy. The temperature dependence of resistances in Bi2Te3 nanowires fabricated under different concentration of HTeO2 + reveals the transformation of the carriers' main scattering mechanism. This study could provide a better understanding of the deposition process of Bi2Te3 nanowires.
