I am a Research Scientist in Huawei Noah’s Ark Laboratory. I obtained my master’s degree from Nanyang Technological University. My current research interests primarily focus on Vision-Language Models (VLM), post-training data flywheel, pretrained visual encoders, 3D scene understanding, and embodied intelligence. Additionally, I have a strong passion for portrait photography and have been practicing it intensively lately. The application of large language models (LLMs) in quantitative finance is another area I actively follow in my spare time—I’ve recently been replicating and designing quantitative investment agents related to this field.

We are now recruiting project/research interns. If you are interested in, please directly send your CV to yzhou037@e.ntu.edu.sg.
